# WELCOME

This is the repository of team GenX. It contains the work of a group of STAT 540 students on a project titled the **Differential methylation analysis of preeclamptic placental tissue using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K array** [click here to check out our poster on it :)](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_GenX/blob/master/Documents/GenX_poster.pdf)

# REPO Contents
This repo contains three folders. They are:

Folder Name | Description | Link
:------------ | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------:
Code | This folder is our codebase. It contains the different rmd scripts (with detailed comments) used to perform our analysis and generate our findings. | [Click here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_GenX/blob/master/Code/README.md)
Data | This folder holds data sets and data objects used throughout our analysis. It's contents allows readers to reproduce our work. <br/><br/> It does not contain all the datasets used in our analysis (very large files; over 200MB), though extensive mention of them is made in our [pre processing script](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_GenX/blob/master/Code/pre_processing_data.md) and our [test creation script](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_GenX/blob/master/Code/test_data_set_creation.md) | [Click here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_GenX/blob/master/Data/README.md)
Documents | This folder contains documents which explain our aims, challenges and findings in an easy to understand manner. | [Click here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Repo_team_GenX/blob/master/Documents/README.md)
